How to run the code:

Requires Java 

Cd into RL_sim folder and type in the terminal:
java -jar rl_sim.jar 

Click the algorithm you want to run, and you can alter the parameters in the GUI. Small maze is the small MDP. Large maze is the larger MDP. Note that to change the penalty, you must go into the editor and remake the map from scratch, which shouldnâ€™t be bad for the small maze.
