Instructions for running code:

Open the project folder with either InteliJ or Eclipse. 

Add ABAGAIL as an external library: https://github.com/pushkar/ABAGAIL

Required: ABAGAIL, Java 1.8+

Four Peaks Problem: FourPeaksProblem.java
Count Ones: CountOnesProblem.java
Knapsack: KnapsackProblem.java
Randomized Opt: NeuralNetOptimization.java (takes ~50 min to end)
Back Prop: NeuralNetBackPropogation.java

NOTE: there are two values I extracted from the randomized optimization problems: the max eval value and the time it took to run the experiment. I commented out the different println() commands depending on which value I wanted to see.
