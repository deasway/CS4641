Required: sic-kit learn, matplotlib, python, numpy

Clustering experiments are found in clustering folder. Run bank() for banking clusters or wine() for wine clusters. To unnormalize the data, uncomment the lines in the functions

Feature selection algorithms are found in the feature_selection folder. Same steps as above.

Step 3 is in step3.py, again, bank() will run on the banking dataset, and wine() will run on the wine dataset

Step 4 and 5 are in neural net.py, bank() is step 4, bank_cluster() is step 5.
